# ChEMBL Kinase Inhibitor Analysis

This repository contains a comparative analysis of methods for retrieving kinase inhibitor data from the ChEMBL database.

## Overview

The project compares two approaches for identifying kinase inhibitors published after 2022:
1.  **Python + UniProt Mapping:** Uses `bioservices` to identify human kinases via UniProt, maps them to ChEMBL IDs, and queries the database.
2.  **Pure SQL (Recursive):** Uses a recursive SQL query (`gemini_query.sql`) generated by Gemini 3.0 to traverse the ChEMBL protein classification hierarchy.

The results are analyzed in `gemini_chembl.ipynb` to understand discrepancies between the two methods (e.g., regulatory subunits, pseudo-kinases).

## Prerequisites

1.  **ChEMBL Database:** You need a local copy of the ChEMBL SQLite database (tested with ChEMBL 36). Download it from the [ChEMBL FTP site](https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/chembl/ChEMBLdb/latest/).
2.  **Python Environment:** Python 3.8+ is recommended.

## Setup

1.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  Configure Paths:
    Open `gemini_chembl.ipynb` and update the `CHEMBL_SQLITE_PATH` variable to point to your local `.db` file.

## Files

-   `gemini_chembl.ipynb`: Main analysis notebook.
-   `gemini_query.sql`: The recursive SQL query used for the hierarchy-based approach. This query was generated by Gemini 3.0.
-   `kinase_inhibitors_after_2022.csv`: Dataset generated by the Gemimi LLM approach.
-   `kinase_uniprot.csv`: Cache of UniProt kinase IDs (generated by the notebook).
